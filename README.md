# Command Line Games
This repo is for minigames to be played in the terminal.

Ill start out using asciimatics or click to make a default ui used in all games. 
I want to be able to change out a csv or json file and have the game work exatly the same, 
only with different characters or events. 

This is good practice for making my work reusable and easy to read/understand.
