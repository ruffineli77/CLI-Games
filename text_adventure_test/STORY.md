Order of Essential Events


1. Player chooses which items to take on their dive. The player has a 2/7 chance of choosing a progressing item. (gets the player closer to the end.) 
The player can jump in the water or abandon the mission.

2. After creating an entrance at the ?ship part? of the ship, the player chooses one of three paths. 
Each path allows the player to encounter a unique set of items, enemies, obstacles. 
In order to progress a door must be open/revealed etc.

Stealth entrance places you in the cargo hold below the gun deck. 
Path- cargo hold > galley/spare rigging > brig > infirmary > admirals wing > captain cabin

Direct entrance places you in the center of the gun deck.
Path- gun deck > officers quarters > brig > infirmary > admirals wing > captain cabin

Destroy entrance places you in the rum and powder storeroom. 
powder storeroom > destroyed cargo hold > main deck > quarter deck > admirals wing > captains cabin

3. The player leaves the open world area and faces their first progressing obstacle. 
The player must use what they learned/gathered so far to 1 unlock a door, find a secret path, or force their way into the largest area of the ship.

4. The player makes their way to the main hall of the ship. Many doors and rooms fill this area, some completely intact, others are just mounds of rubble.
This is where players do alot of exploring and learning in order to figure out how to make thier way to the back of the ship. They must go through the gun deck, down into the galley, through the brig, then up into the infirmary, and finally to the admiral's wing. They meet the mermaid, skeleton, and ghost.
Each of the npcs give the Player the hint to ?clever puzzle? This puzzle lets the player gives the player a passcode to get past the ghost of Admiral Perceus.

5. When the player enters the admiral wing the ship begins to creak and lurch back and forth. This starts a 5 minute countdown until the ship falls off the edge of the trench into the abyss.
They must find the key, enter, and exit the captain's cabin in this time or they will lose the game.
There are three rooms in the admirals wing. The navigation/map room and the war room are unlocked. The captains cabin is locked and contains the item your contact is looking for. 


6. Within the captain's cabin on a large bed is the map that your contact sent you to find. The players have an opportunity to explore the cabin and finda chest with pearls and jewels, an attendance sheet, 
If the player finds and reads the captains journal they discover a clue about who their contact could be. Once your contacts desired item is located it is automatically picked up and the timer stops. Finally the mystery being that has been following you throughout the journey (octopus, baracuda, shark) appears and startles your crew. It swims through a small tunnel that leads to the outside of the ship. Your crew then follows and begins the ascent to the surface. If you found the whale sound ocarina, A blue whale crashes through the ship, breaking it apart, and sends it falling into the trench below. 

7. The end of the game is a cliffhanger where you meet with your contact face to face.
